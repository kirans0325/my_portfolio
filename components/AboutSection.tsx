              Hi, my name is Kiran and I am a{" "}
              <span className="font-bold">{"highly ambitious"}</span>,
              <span className="font-bold">{" self-motivated"}</span>, and
              <span className="font-bold">{" driven"}</span> software engineer
              based in Vizag, India.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              As a seasoned professional in the software industry, I graduated
              from GMIT, Andhra Pradesh, in 2014 with a Bachelor's degree in
              Chemical Engineering. Over the past nine years, I've cultivated
              expertise in the pharmaceutical sector, but my true passion lies
              in software engineering and web development. In the last 1.5
              years, I've dedicated myself to mastering programming languages
              and actively engaged in web development projects through
              freelancing.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Now, I am actively seeking a permanent remote role that allows me
              to leverage my chemical engineering background alongside my
              newfound skills in the dynamic field of software development.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I believe that you should{" "}
              <span className="font-bold text-teal-500">
                never stop growing
              </span>{" "}
              and that&#39;s what I strive to do, I have a passion for
              technology and a desire to always push the limits of what is
              possible. I am excited to see where my career takes me and am
              always open to new opportunities. ðŸ™‚
